 * \brief PSA cryptography module: Mbed TLS buffer size macros
 *
 * This file contains the definitions of macros that are useful to
 * compute buffer sizes. The signatures and semantics of these macros
 * are standardized, but the definitions are not, because they depend on
 * the available algorithms and, in some cases, on permitted tolerances
 * on buffer sizes.
