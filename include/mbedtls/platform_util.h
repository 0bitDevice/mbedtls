 * \brief       Securely zeroize a buffer

 *
 * \note        This implementation should never be optimized out by the
 *              compiler
 *
 * \note        It is extremely difficult to guarantee that calls to
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() are not removed by aggressive
 *              compiler optimizations in a portable way. For this reason, Mbed
 *              TLS provides the configuration option
 *              MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_ZEROIZE_ALT, which allows users to configure
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() to use a suitable implementation for
 *              their platform and needs
